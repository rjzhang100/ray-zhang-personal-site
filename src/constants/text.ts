I'm currently also at Konrad Group as a software developer intern! Outside of work and school, I'm a huge car nerd, spending most of my free time either learning about or working on cars. I'm also a huge music fan, and pretty much always am listening to something throughout my day. Feel free to explore this site to learn more about me, and some of the cool stuff I've been up to! I'm always open to connect and meet new people, so shoot me a message!",

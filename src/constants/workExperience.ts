  [KG]: "I've learned so much since starting at Konrad, and I continue to learn more and more. I'm so grateful for the incredible team and all the challenges and problems I've had to solve. From building out a full stack web application from scratch in a small team of 4 (which is ready for internal company use!) to providing software solutions for the leading Canadian commerical property management company, I've been able to develop my skills in ways I couldn't have imagined.",
  [SEMTECH]:
    'Semtech (formerly Sierra Wireless) was my first software engineering role. I began on the testing environment (ATE), where I added new tests, and improved the existing tests to achieve 100% pass rate. I also helped the onboarding of new teams onto ATE. I was then moved to the Web team, where I participated in sprints and completed feature/bug tickets.',
  [EARLS]:
    "I started in May 2022 as a host at Earls, before eventually joining the bar team as a bartender. Learning to make drinks, working with the team and just getting to meet a whole bunch of new faces everyday was so much fun. Going for a shift behind the bar was a perfect change of pace for me from all the code and lecture material I'd be looking at throughout the day. Super fun experience and honored to have been part of the gang.",
  [KINJO]:
    "We all start somewhere right? I joined Kinjo during Covid, and it ended up being a massive growth opportunity for me. Seeing my coworkers throughout the week kept me sane through all the isolation of Covid, and really helped me in opening up more. Even though serving was super stressful and angry delivery drivers aren't fun to deal with, I have nothing but good memories thinking back on my time at Kinjo.",
